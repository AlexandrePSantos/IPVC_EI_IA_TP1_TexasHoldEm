GPT:

1 - Define the Rules: Start by defining the basic rules of the game, which will determine how the game is played. In this case, we will use the following rules:
	Each player is dealt two private cards
	There is a round of betting
	Three community cards are dealt face up
	There is a second round of betting
	A fourth community card is dealt face up
	There is a third round of betting
	A fifth and final community card is dealt face up
	There is a final round of betting
	The player with the best five-card hand, using any combination of their two private cards and the five community cards, wins the pot.

2 - Define the Game State: Create a data structure to keep track of the game state. This data structure should include the following elements:
	Deck of cards
	Two player hands
	Community cards
	Pot
	Current bet

3 - Shuffle the Deck: Shuffle the deck of cards to randomize the order of the cards.

4 - Deal the Cards: Deal two private cards to each player, starting with the first player, then the second player.

5 - First Round of Betting: Start the first round of betting, with the first player to act based on the table position. The players can either call, raise, or fold. If a player raises, the next player must match that bet or fold. If a player folds, they forfeit their hand and any bets they've made.

6 - Deal the Flop: After the first round of betting is complete, deal three community cards face up on the table. This is known as the "flop".

7 - Second Round of Betting: Start the second round of betting, with the first player to act based on the table position. The players can either call, raise, or fold.

8 - Deal the Turn: After the second round of betting is complete, deal a fourth community card face up on the table. This is known as the "turn".

9 - Third Round of Betting: Start the third round of betting, with the first player to act based on the table position. The players can either call, raise, or fold.

10 - Deal the River: After the third round of betting is complete, deal a fifth and final community card face up on the table. This is known as the "river".

11 - Final Round of Betting: Start the final round of betting, with the first player to act based on the table position. The players can either call, raise, or fold.

12 - Determine the Winner: After the final round of betting is complete, determine the winner of the hand. The winner is the player with the best five-card hand, using any combination of their two private cards and the five community cards. If there is a tie, the pot is split between the tied players.

13 - Update the Game State: Update the game state by distributing the pot to the winner and resetting the deck, hands, and community cards for the next hand.

14 - Repeat: Repeat steps 4-13 for as many hands as desired.
